# ✈️ Flight Delay Optimization & Analysis  

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on **flight delay analysis and optimization** using **Machine Learning, Data Analysis, and NLP-powered interfaces**.  
It provides actionable insights for airlines and airports to reduce delays, identify bottlenecks, and recommend optimal flight scheduling.  

Key Features:  
- ✅ **Flight Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
- ✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on delays & busiest slots**  
- ✅ **Machine Learning Models for Scheduling filghts and Delay Prediction **  
- ✅ **Best Departure & Arrival Time Recommendations**  
- ✅ **NLP-based User Interface for querying flight data**  
- ✅ **Visualization Dashboards**

## 🔬 Data Preprocessing & Analysis  
- Converted raw flight data into structured format.  
- Cleaned missing values, standardized timestamps, and calculated delays.  
- Feature engineering: **Departure Delay, Arrival Delay, Weekday, Route, Aircraft Encoding**.  

📊 Example Insights:  
- Busiest departure hours identified.  
- Average delay patterns across weekdays.  
- Aircraft types most prone to delays.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model  

We implemented multiple ML models to predict **departure delays**:  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- Gradient Boosting Regressor  
- XGBoost  
- Ridge Regression  
- Neural Networks  

📌 **Best Model**: Random Forest (MAE ≈ 20 minutes, R² ≈ 0.58)  

🔍 Features Used:  
- Scheduled Hour  
- Weekday  
- Aircraft Type  
- Route  

The system can also **suggest the best time slot** for a given aircraft & route to minimize delays.

## 💬 NLP User Interface  

An **NLP-powered interface** was developed to allow users to query the dataset in natural language.  
Example queries:  
- “Show me the busiest slot on Mondays.”  
- “Which aircraft has the highest delay impact?”  
- “What is the best time to fly from Mumbai to Delhi on Wednesday?”
